<p>Every shift in the zodiac carries an invitation, and as the sun begins to move toward Sagittarius, the air feels lighter, more curious and more open. After Scorpio’s deep waters of introspection and emotional renewal, Sagittarius rises like dawn, wide, open, and full of new horizons, reminding us that growth doesn’t end with transformation, it continues through exploration. This is the season of perspective, of seeking meaning beyond what we already know, and of trusting that the path unfolds as we move.<p>

<p>Sagittarius, ruled by Jupiter, the planet of wisdom and expansion, encourages us to stretch our limits, not just in the physical sense, but in how we think, dream and believe. It’s a reminder that curiosity itself is a form of faith, the belief that there’s more to discover, more to understand and more to become.</p>

<p>Pause here. When was the last time you stepped outside your comfort zone, even in a small way, and felt yourself expand because of it?</p>

    This week, the sun’s energy encourages movement, both inward and outward. Sagittarius teaches us that life itself is the greatest teacher if we’re willing to look with wonder. It reminds us that optimism isn’t about ignoring what’s difficult, it’s about seeing the possibilities that exist alongside the challenges.

<p>
   Before you scroll, take a moment to ask yourself: Where in your life have you been playing small out of fear of uncertainty, and what might open up if you allowed yourself to take a leap?
</p>

<p>
    Astrology, at its best, helps us recognize our own cycles of expansion and contraction. After the deep inner work of Scorpio, Sagittarius offers perspective, the ability to step back and see our experiences from a distance and recognize how far we’ve come. It’s about reframing, reimagining and reclaiming the joy of learning.

<p>This week, engage your sense of curiosity. Read something outside your usual interests, explore a new neighborhood, or start a conversation that stretches your worldview. If you journal, write about a belief you’ve outgrown and what might replace it. Allow your curiosity to become a form of self-trust, a way of saying I’m open to learning what life wants to show me.<p>

<p id="Prompt">What does freedom mean to you right now? Is it a feeling, a choice or a state of mind? Write, draw, or meditate on the spaces in your life that feel open and the ones that feel ready to expand. Notice how even a small shift in perspective can create room to breathe, reminding you that growth is not about change, but about returning to who you’ve always been.</p>
